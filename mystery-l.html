                        <h2 class="section-title-inline-1">The "Mystery Language" of Yahuah</h2>


                        I want to reveal that The Bible is written in <i>another language</i> or <i>tongue</i> if
                        you will. A language we must <i>learn</i> to speak if we are to understand such things as
                        The <i>Yahushaic Covenant</i>, the <i>Transgression of Desolation</i>, The <i>Abomination of
                            Desolation</i>, the identity of the false messiah, <i>Grace</i>, <i>Lib-erty</i>, and
                        the <i>Law</i> of <i>Yahuah</i>. It has been my goal over the course of my book series to
                        slowly and progressively open the readers <i>eyes and ears</i> to this language the Bible is
                        written in. <br> <br>

                        Very few (only the <i>Chosen Few</i> known as <i>Nazarenes</i>) truly understand the things
                        of <i>Yahuah</i> or the language in which the Bible was written in. <i>Yahusha</i> was the
                        true teacher of <i>Righteousness</i> (the <i>Torah</i>) and he veiled every word he spoke in
                        this <i>Mystery Language</i> using <i>parables</i>, <i>parallels</i>, <i>id-ioms</i>, etc. I
                        have been disclosing this <i>Mystery Language</i> throughout this book series. <br> <br>

                        I am attempting to open our <i>eyes</i> to the spiritual meaning of the physical
                        <i>metaphors</i>, <i>parables</i>, <i>idiom</i>, <i>shadows</i>, and <i>parallels</i>.
                        Hopefully I can help impart the <i>Hebraic</i> mindset and meaning behind the <i>Hebrew</i>
                        language, to better understand our English <i>translations</i>. The Bible has been
                        <i>Hellenized</i> by Greeks who twisted the scriptures. <br> <br>


                        Not even the <i>Hebrew</i> people understood <i>Yahusha</i> when he spoke to them. This is
                        because <i>Yahuah</i> has hidden Himself and The Truth of His Kingdom in a language few
                        understand. <br> <br>

                        That language we (who have The <i>Spirit of Holiness</i> guiding us) speak, in another
                        <i>tongue</i>, is a <i>secret language</i> that is revealed only to a chosen few by The
                        <i>Spirit of Holiness</i>. It is not a bunch of babbling words no one understands, as is
                        taught by <i>Pentecostal Christianity</i>. <br> <br>

                        It is not foreign languages (although in the early first century others did hear the
                        disciples in their own native <i>language</i>). What I am speaking of here is a
                        <i>metaphorical language</i> of <i>parables</i>, <i>parallels</i>, <i>idioms</i>, and
                        <i>prophetic portraits</i> that transcend all <i>languages</i> The <i>secret things</i> of
                        the Kingdom of <i>Yahuah</i> are veiled in The Bible. The <i>Apostle Sha'ul</i> addresses
                        this other <i>Mystery Language</i> that is translated as <i>speaking in tongues</i> below: <br>

                        <em>1 Corinthians 2:4-15</em>
                        4 And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom (neither
                        <i>Sha'ul</i> nor <i>Yahusha</i> spoke in literal terms), but in the demonstration of
                        the <i>Spirit of Holiness</i> and of power (which gives us understanding of hidden
                        things): ...


                        <em>1 Timothy 3:9</em>
                        9 Holding the <i>mystery</i> (hidden or secret things: G3466) of the faith in a pure
                        <i>conscience</i>. <br> <br>




                        This is why the Roman/Greek based <i>Christian Church</i> and all of its <i>pastors and
                            teachers</i> cannot and do not teach The Truth; but rather misinterpret, mistranslate,
                        and teach false <i>doctrines</i>. They simply do not speak the <i>Mystery Language</i> of
                        <i>Yahuah</i> and do not understand what they read. They are spiritually <i>blind</i>,
                        <i>deaf</i>, and <i>dumb</i>! <br> <br>

                        They look to the <i>Greek</i> words for meaning and pour into those <i>Greek</i> words all
                        the pagan implications of <i>Hellenism</i>. This began as <i>Sha'ul</i> took The
                        <i>Gospel</i> to a pagan <i>Greek</i> world. <br> <br>





                        <em>2 Peter 3:16</em>
                        <i>Sha'ul</i> speaking of these (hidden) things in all of his letters... <br>





                        So let us seek out His <i>Wisdom</i> and understand what these <i>secret things</i> and
                        <i>Mystery Language</i> are all about. This is a <i>learned language</i>. <i>Yahuah</i> has
                        literally hidden Himself in His Word through a <i>Mystery Language</i>, also referred to as
                        <i>hidden things</i>, <i>deep things</i>, and <i>mysteries</i>. <br> <br>




                        <em>Deuteronomy 29:4</em>
                        Yet <i>Yahuah</i> has not given you a <i>heart</i> to perceive (hidden Spiritual things),
                        and <i>eyes</i> to see hidden (Spiritual things), and <i>ears</i> to hear (hidden Spiritual
                        things), unto this day. <br> <br>




                        The <i>secret things</i> were kept hidden by <i>Yahuah</i> and only <i>those physical
                            things</i> were given to Israel in the <i>Mosaic Covenant</i> i.e. the <i>letter of the
                            Law</i>. The Spiritual Intent was not given at that time: <br>




                        <em>Deuteronomy 29</em>
                        29 The <i>secret things</i> belong unto <i>Yahuah</i> our <i>God</i>: but those (physical)
                        things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all
                        the words (letters) of this <i>law</i>. <br> <br>




                        The intent behind the <i>Law</i> is hidden and revealed to only those who have a
                        <i>heart</i> to perceive it (those with <i>eyes</i> to see and <i>ears</i> to hear). So what
                        does <i>se-cret things</i> above in <i>Deuteronomy 29</i> mean?




                        Below is the word <i>secret</i> or <i>hidden</i> in <i>Hebrew</i>:




                        <em>Hebrew Lexicon word H5641</em> - <i>Secret</i> is the word <i>Cathar</i> (saw-thar')
                        which means:
                        <br>
                        I. to hide, conceal
                        A. (Niphal)
                        i. to hide oneself <br>
                        ii. to be hidden, be concealed <br>
                        1. (Piel) to hide carefully <br>
                        2. (Pual) to be hidden carefully, be concealed <br>
                        3. (Hiphil) to conceal, hide <br>
                        4. (Hithpael) to hide oneself carefully <br> <br>

                        <strong><em>Yahuah</em></strong> has literally hidden Himself in plain sight! No matter what
                        language the Bible is translated into, the Mystery Language is very present in every
                        lan-guage. But it must be learned for the reader to understand and the reader must be guided
                        by The Spirit of Holiness to receive it. We have His Word but only those who speak His
                        Mystery Language (like <em>Yahusha</em>) understand what those words mean! <em>Daniel</em>
                        was given this mystery language: <br>

                        <strong>Daniel 2</strong><br> 20 <em>Daniel</em> answered and said, Blessed be the name
                        of God (<strong><em>Yahuah</em></strong>) for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are
                        his: 21 And he changes the times and the seasons: he removes kings, and sets up kings:
                        he gives (Spir-itual) wisdom unto the (chosen) wise, and knowledge to them that know
                        (Spiritual) understanding: 22 He reveals the deep and secret things! <br> <br>

                        <em>Isaiah</em> was eventually given this Mystery Language after many years of not
                        understanding: <br>

                        <strong>Isaiah 48</strong><br> 6 You have heard these things; look at them all. Will you
                        not admit them? 'From now on I will tell you of new things, of hidden things unknown to
                        you.? They are created now, and not long ago; you have not heard of them before today.
                        So you cannot say, "Yes, I knew of them." & You have neither heard nor understood; from
                        of old your ears have not been open. <br> <br>

                        <strong><em>Yahuah</em></strong> simply did not give The Spirit of Holiness to all of His
                        Chosen that teaches us to know these hidden secret things until The <em>Yahushaic
                            Covenant</em>. Even then, <em>Yahusha</em> continued to veil these things behind
                        parables and parallels so that only those so chosen could understand: <br>

                        <strong>Matthew 13</strong><br> 10 The disciples came to him and asked, 'Why do you speak
                        to the people in parables?' 11 He replied, 'Because the knowledge of the secrets of the
                        kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them. 12 Whoever has (the Spirit of
                        Holiness) will be given (speaking of a future date when <strong><em>Yahuah</em></strong>
                        would pour out His Spirit) more (hid-den knowledge), and they will have an abundance (of
                        Spiritual under-standing). Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from
                        them. 13 This is why I speak to them in parables: 'Though seeing (with their physical
                        mind), they do not see (the Spiritual parallel); though hearing (with their physical
                        ear), they do not hear (the Spiritual Truth) or understand (the Spiritual mean-ing). 14
                        In them is fulfilled the prophecy of <em>Isaiah</em>: "You will be ever hearing but
                        never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving. 15 For this people's
                        heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their
                        eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with
                        their hearts and turn, and I would heal them." 16 But blessed are your eyes because they
                        see (the physical to Spiritual parallels), and your ears because they hear (the Truth).
                        17 For truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see
                        but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it (because it was not
                        revealed until The <em>Yahushaic Covenant</em> and only then to a Chosen Few). <br> <br>

                        <strong>Matthew 13:35</strong><br> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the
                        prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept
                        secret from the foundation of the world.
                        Yes, <strong><em>Yahuah</em></strong> has hidden Himself in His Word in a Mystery Language
                        that only the Chosen Few are ever given eyes to see and ears to hear and a mind to
                        understand. You must have The Spirit of Holiness who teaches you this Mystery Language to
                        understand the Word of <strong><em>Yahuah</em></strong>.
                        This Mystery Language is spoken in parables, physical to Spiritual parallels, idioms,
                        proverbs, etc. It is a metaphorical language and that is what "speak-ing in tongues" really
                        means. When The Spirit of Holiness moved on the disciples in the "upper room" on Shav'uot,
                        their Spiritual eyes and ears were opened and they began to "see" and speak in this Mystery
                        Language as well. <br> <br>

                        The Apostle <em>Sha'ul</em> (as we read at the beginning of this section in <strong>1
                            Corinthians 2:4-15</strong>) spoke this "Mystery Lan-guage" and called this Mystery
                        Language "another tongue": <br>

                        <strong>1. Corinthians 14:2</strong><br> 2. For he that speaks in an unknown tongue
                        (Mystery Metaphorical Language) speaks not unto the physical things of men, but unto
                        (the hidden Spiritual things of) 3. <strong><em>Yahuah</em></strong>: for no man
                        understands him (they don't have eyes to see, ears to hear); however in the spirit (of
                        Holiness) he speaks mysteries (of the Kingdom of <strong><em>Yahuah</em></strong>). <br> <br>

                        <strong>King Solomon</strong> was given the Mystery Language. We read in the Book of Wisdom
                        below as <b>Solomon</b> describes the "Wisdom of <strong><em>Yahuah</em></strong>":


                        <strong>Wisdom 2</strong><br>
                        21 Such things they did imagine, and were deceived: for their own wickedness hath blinded them.
                        22 As for the mysteries of <strong><em>Yahuah</em></strong>, they knew them not: neither hoped
                        they for the wages of righteousness, nor discerned a reward for blameless souls. 23 For
                        <strong><em>Yahuah</em></strong> created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of His
                        own eternity. <br> <br>



                        <strong>Wisdom 6:22</strong><br>
                        As for wisdom, what she is, and how she came up, I (<strong><em>Yahuah</em></strong>) will tell
                        you (<b>Solomon</b>), and will not hide mysteries from you: but will seek her out from the
                        beginning of her nativity, and bring the knowledge of her into light, and will not pass over the
                        truth. <br> <br>



                        <strong>Wisdom 8:4</strong><br>
                        For she (wisdom) is privy to the mysteries of the knowledge of <strong><em>Yahuah</em></strong>,
                        and a lover of his works. <br> <br>


                        We read in the book of <b>Ben Sira</b> (written by the Jewish scribe Shimon ben Yahusha ben
                        Eliezer ben Sira of Jerusalem nearly 200 years before <b>Yahusha</b> lived which is considered
                        the earliest witness to a canon of the books of the prophets): <br>


                        <strong>Ben Sira 3</strong><br>
                        1. Many are in high place, and of renown: but mysteries are revealed unto the meek (humble who
                        seek after <strong><em>Yahuah</em></strong>'s wisdom). 2. For the power of
                        <strong><em>Yahuah</em></strong> is great, and He is honoured of the lowly. 21 Seek not out
                        things that are too hard for you, neither search the things that are above your strength. 22 But
                        what is commanded of you, think upon with reverence, for you do not need to see with your
                        (physical) eyes the things that are in secret. <br> <br>


                        Now, if you carefully read the verses above, you will now know and understand that the secret,
                        hidden mysteries of <strong><em>Yahuah</em></strong> are told through parables (and parallels)
                        that not everyone is going to understand. Only the humble and repentant heart (inner man, the
                        righteousness seeking mindset) will perceive them. <br> <br>

                        This is what "speaking in tongues" actually is - it isn't a language (like Sumerian or English
                        or Greek or Hebrew) per se, but messages communicated through the Holy Spirit (parables and
                        parallels) that are conveyed in every language the Bible is written in and translated to.
                        "Speaking in tongues" is "speaking in the mystery language or tongue" that the Bible is written
                        in. <br> <br>

                        This is what happened on Shav'uot, <strong><em>Yahuah</em></strong> opened the Spiritual eyes
                        and ears of the followers of <b>Yahusha</b>, they began to "understand" the language
                        <b>Yahusha</b> spoke, and they too began to speak in the same way and everyone around them
                        understood them in their native language. <br> <br>


                        <strong>Acts 10</strong><br>
                        44 While Peter was still speaking these words he was not speaking a foreign language or
                        (babbling
                        a bunch of nonsense), the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were listening to the message (and
                        opened their eyes to the Spiritual Parallels and meaning of the words <b>Peter</b> was
                        speaking). 45 All the circumcised (Jewish) believers who came with <b>Peter</b> were amazed,
                        because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles (House of Israel) also
                        (they too began to understand the physical to Spiritual parallels and parables). 46 For they
                        were hearing (in their native language) them speaking with tongues (in the Mystery Language like
                        <b>Yahusha</b> spoke) and exalting <strong><em>Yahuah</em></strong>. <br> <br>

                        <strong>Acts 2:4</strong><br>
                        And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit (and finally understood the Mystery Language
                        <b>Yahusha</b> spoke), and began to speak with other tongues (or a Mystery Language full of
                        Parables, Idioms, Parallels, etc.), as the Spirit gave them utterance.

                        Only those chosen few who have been given The Spirit of Holiness, who have had their eyes and
                        ears opened, who understand Spiritual things with their mind speak this language and understand
                        it: <br>


                        <strong>Matthew 11:25</strong><br>
                        At that time <b>Yahusha</b> answered and said, I thank you, O Father, Creator of heaven and
                        earth, because you have hid these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them unto
                        babes (this language cannot be taught in human learning institutions, so you can toss out any
                        Theological Degrees Christian pastors and teachers flaunt... they mean NOTHING!). <br> <br>


                        But there are very few who are risen up at the time of the end to unravel the hidden mysteries
                        and unlock the seals placed over His Word: <br>


                        <strong>Revelation 10</strong><br>
                        4 Now when the seven thunders uttered their voices, I was about to write; but I heard a voice
                        from heaven saying to me, "Seal up the things which the seven thunders uttered, and do not write
                        them." And they were hidden until the very end of time and given to men of Wisdom risen up for
                        the appointed time. <br> <br>



                        <strong>Daniel 12</strong><br>
                        He replied, "Go your way, <b>Daniel</b>, because the words are rolled up and sealed until the
                        time of the end. 10 Many (chosen by <strong><em>Yahuah</em></strong> to teach) will be purified,
                        made spotless and refined, but the wicked will continue to be wicked. None of the wicked will
                        understand, but those who (chosen by <strong><em>Yahuah</em></strong>) are wise will understand. <br> <br>



                        <strong>Daniel 11</strong><br>
                        32 Those who do wickedly (abolish the Law) against the covenant he shall corrupt with flattery
                        (false teachings); but the people who know their God (you know <strong><em>Yahuah</em></strong>
                        by keeping His Law 1 John 2:3) shall be strong, and carry out great exploits. 33 And those men
                        of Wisdom who understand (the hidden mysteries) shall instruct many; ... <br> <br>



                        35 And some of those of understanding shall fall, to refine them, purify them, and make them
                        white, until the time of the end; because it is still for the appointed time. <br> <br>


                        Well, we are at that appointed time of "the end". We need those men of Wisdom who understand
                        these hidden things to come forward and teach, because the identity of the Antichrist and such
                        things require this type of understanding. While we all would like to think that we can just
                        open up our modern translations and understand the words on the page, this is not what the Bible
                        says. <br> <br>

                        We need men who have "eyes and ears to hear" and understand the secret things (whom
                        <strong><em>Yahuah</em></strong> moves on and anoints) to teach us, not self-appointed teachers.
                        The first step in our journey is to truly know and understand the set apart names so this is
                        where I will begin.
