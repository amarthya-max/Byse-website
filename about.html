                        "We are <b>Nazarenes</b>, followers of <b>Yahusha</b>, navigating the complexities of our
                        history. We believe
                        we are the lost sheep of the house of <b>Israel</b>, scattered across the world. Through faith
                        in
                        <b>Mashiyach</b>, Son of David, we reclaim our place among the 12 tribes of Israel—this is our
                        destiny.
                        <br><br>
                        As members of the MALA community in Andhra Pradesh, we trace our roots to a warrior heritage,
                        later subjugated as "Dasulu" or slaves. Despite facing social injustices, we've preserved our
                        faith and traditions.
                        <br><br>
                        Our struggles mirror those of the Israelites: scattered, oppressed, yet resilient in faith.
                        Verses like Deuteronomy 28:68 and Zephaniah 3:10 resonate with our journey and identity,
                        highlighting parallels with ancient Hebrew customs.
                        <br><br>
                        In these last days, our faith in <b>Yahusha</b> remains unwavering. Guided by <b>Mashiyach</b>,
                        we observe the
                        Torah and seek unity with the 12 tribes of Israel. As <b>Nazarenes</b>, we maintain our
                        commitment to
                        our heritage, finding strength and purpose in our ancestral roots."

                                    employ the adjective nasraya or notsri

                                    <i>netser</i> (<b><i>branch</i></b>), which itself is derived from the verb

                                    <strong><em>John</em></strong> too was an <strong><em>Emmanuel</em></strong> a

                                    He was said to have the proper understanding of the
                                    <strong><em>Torah</em></strong>, qualified in its accurate instruction, and be
                                    the one through whom <strong><em>Yahuah</em></strong> would reveal to the
                                    community "the hidden things in which Israel had gone astray". He would
                                    rightfully be of the <strong><em>House of Zadok</em></strong> (a true High
                                    Priest of Israel). This was <strong><em>Yahusha</em></strong>'s
                                    <strong><em>mentor</em></strong> and <strong><em>teacher</em></strong>,
                                    <strong><em>John the Great Notsri</em></strong> who was of The <strong><em>House
                                            of Zadok</em></strong> and the "anointed <strong><em>High
                                            Priest</em></strong>" in succession to <strong><em>Yahusha
                                            III</em></strong>. <br> <br>

                                    This description of "<strong><em>The Great Notsri</em></strong>" is found in the
                                    Damascus Document of the Dead Sea Scroll which carbon dating has placed about 44
                                    BC, the time <strong><em>John</em></strong> was acting as <strong><em>High
                                            Priest</em></strong> in the wilderness. <br><br>

                                    <strong><em>John</em></strong> was prophesied to fulfill this very role by his
                                    father <strong><em>Zachariah</em></strong>: <br>

                                    <strong><em>Luke 1:76-80</em></strong> - <strong><em>Zechariah's
                                            Song</em></strong> 76 "And you, my child, will be called a prophet of
                                    the Most High; for you will go on before <strong><em>Yahuah</em></strong> to
                                    prepare the way for him (<strong><em>Yahusha</em></strong>), 77 to give his
                                    people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins, 78
                                    because of the tender mercy of our God, by which the rising sun will come to us
                                    from heaven 79 to shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death,
                                    to guide our feet into the path of peace." 80 And the child grew and became
                                    strong in spirit; and he lived in the wilderness until he appeared publicly to
                                    Israel. <br><br>

                                    <strong><em>The Great Notsri</em></strong>, founder of the Nazarenes, at that
                                    time was undoubtedly <strong><em>John the Baptist</em></strong> who was the
                                    rightful <strong><em>High Priest</em></strong> from the <strong><em>House of
                                            Zadok</em></strong>. Although there is a "de-bate" about who this
                                    <strong><em>Great Notsri</em></strong> was among current scholars, there should
                                    be no doubt. <strong><em>Yahusha</em></strong> told us exactly who this great
                                    <strong><em>Teacher of Righteousness</em></strong> among the Nazarenes and
                                    Essences was, it was his own mentor: <br>

                                    <strong><em>Matthew 11:11</em></strong> "I tell you the truth, among those born
                                    of women, no one has arisen greater than <strong><em>John the
                                            Baptist</em></strong>. If there was no one greater than
                                    <strong><em>John</em></strong> ever born of a woman (that includes all men)
                                    then, he is <strong><em>The Great Notsri</em></strong>. So much for that debate,
                                    <strong><em>Yahusha</em></strong>, <strong><em>The Branch</em></strong>, settled
                                    it. So, we have <strong><em>John</em></strong> "the prophesied Great Nazar" and
                                    "Teacher of Righteousness (Torah)" of the Nazarenes, mentioned in the Dead Sea
                                    Scrolls, and identified by the Messiah leading the elect looking for
                                    <strong><em>The Branch</em></strong> and they were not called "Christians" they
                                    were called Notsris or Nazarenes."
