                                    <strong><em>Mashiyach</em></strong> is greater than his ancestor
                                    <strong><em>Dawid</em></strong> because, unlike <strong><em>Dawid</em></strong>,
                                    <strong><em>Mashiyach</em></strong> is an eternal and global ruler given

                                    (<strong><em>Daniel 7:1-14</em></strong>). <br> <br> In talking about the human side

                                    <strong><em>Mashiyach</em></strong>, we affirm that he was literally and
                                    completely a human being, not the appearance of flesh only.
                                    <strong><em>Mashiyach</em></strong> was fully human in order to suffer, bleed
                                    and die for our benefit (<strong><em>Isaiah 53:8-12</em></strong>,
                                    <strong><em>Zechariah 12:10</em></strong>), and he did nothing in terms of
                                    either miracles or teachings that his Father <strong><em>YHWH</em></strong> had
                                    not previously commanded or revealed to the prophets of Israel.
                                    (<strong><em>John 6:32, 10:18, 12:49; 14:21, 24, 31; 15:10</em></strong>). <br><br>

                                    stake, for then all the Universe would have ceased. Instead, it was
                                    <strong><em>Y'shua's</em></strong> purely human will and
                                    <strong><em>nefesh</em></strong> (soul/life force) that died
                                    (<strong><em>Matthew 26:34</em></strong>, <strong><em>Mark 14:34</em></strong>),

                                    We believe the nature of "Godhead" is revealed in
                                    <strong><em>Tanakh</em></strong>, specifically <strong><em>Isaiah
                                            53:1</em></strong> as the "arm of <strong><em>YHWH</em></strong>."
                                    <strong><em>Mashiyach</em></strong> as <strong><em>YHWH</em></strong>'s saving
                                    and forgiving arm comes in <strong><em>YHWH</em></strong>'s own Name
                                    (<strong><em>Exodus 6:6</em></strong>, <strong><em>23:20-22</em></strong>;
                                    <strong><em>John 17:11</em></strong>) and is directly representative of his
                                    relationship to His Father. An arm has no separated will from the body but moves
                                    under direct command, as do the rest of the limbs, of the mind. In the same way,
                                    it is an error to posit that the divine side of <strong><em>Y'shua</em></strong>
                                    is a separate entity from the Divine Mind of His Father
                                    <strong><em>YHWH</em></strong>, although <strong><em>Y'shua</em></strong>
                                    clearly also had his own human will, as well (<strong><em>Matthew
                                            26:39</em></strong>).

                                    We believe that the Hebrew <strong><em>Tanakh</em></strong>, commonly and
                                    erroneously referred to as the "Old Testament" is current, binding,
                                    authoritative, and infallible. There is no conflict whatsoever between
                                    <strong><em>Tanakh</em></strong> and the Renewed Covenant, and we believe
                                    further that the Renewed Covenant also sheds much light on how
                                    <strong><em>Tanakh</em></strong> is best understood (called "fulfilled" in many
                                    areas). The <strong><em>Torah</em></strong> therefore has not passed away one
                                    yodh, as <strong><em>Y'shua</em></strong> himself said (<strong><em>Matthew
                                            5:17-19</em></strong>, <strong><em>Luke 16:16-17</em></strong>) since

                                    proper practice has been preserved and can be ascertained to a high degree of
                                    certainty.

                                    We believe that the promises <strong><em>YHWH</em></strong> made to the Twelve
                                    Tribes of Israel include Judah, and furthermore, that Judah is blessed of
                                    <strong><em>YHWH</em></strong> (<strong><em>Genesis 49:11</em></strong>,
                                    <strong><em>Zechariah 8:23</em></strong>, <strong><em>Luke
                                            15:11-32</em></strong>, <strong><em>John 4:22</em></strong>,
                                    <strong><em>Romans 11:1-29</em></strong>). Conversely, while we can neither
                                    confirm nor deny any individual's belief that they are blood descendants from
                                    one of the Ten Northern Tribes taken into Assyrian captivity in 722 BCE, we can
                                    and do most certainly affirm that it is incumbent upon every human being,
                                    regardless of lineage, to embrace both <strong><em>Torah</em></strong>
                                    observance and the identity of <strong><em>Y'shua</em></strong> as
                                    <strong><em>YHWH's Mashiyach</em></strong>. <br><br>

                                    We further believe that the Renewed Covenant was first directed to Judah and
                                    Israel, and then to anyone else who joins with them (<strong><em>Jeremiah
                                            31:31-34</em></strong>, <strong><em>Ephesians 2:11-13</em></strong>,
                                    <strong><em>Hebrews 8:8</em></strong>). The tribe of Judah is the root that
                                    supports the nations as well as the other Tribes of Israel (<strong><em>Genesis
                                            49:11</em></strong>), not the other way around. If individual members,
                                    Jewish or Gentile, natural or wild branches are broken off, it is for violating
                                    Set Apart standards with no ethnic considerations given, since
                                    <strong><em>YHWH</em></strong> is no respecter of persons for those who violate
                                    His covenant (<strong><em>Leviticus 18:28</em></strong>;
                                    <strong><em>20:22-27</em></strong>, <strong><em>Romans 1:16</em></strong>;
                                    <strong><em>2:9-10</em></strong>, <strong><em>10:12</em></strong>; <strong><em>1
                                            Corinthians 12:13</em></strong>, <strong><em>Ephesians
                                            6:8</em></strong>, <strong><em>Colossians 3:11</em></strong>). <br><br>

                                    We believe that the tribe of Ephraim (literally and spiritually speaking), though
                                    nearly defunct at one time (<strong><em>Isaiah 7:8</em></strong>,
                                    <strong><em>Hosea 5:3-14</em></strong>, <strong><em>9:16</em></strong>), will
                                    join with the rest of the nations (<strong><em>Jeremiah 31:9,
                                            18-20</em></strong>; <strong><em>Ezekiel 48:5-6</em></strong>,
                                    <strong><em>Hosea 11:8-12</em></strong>) to become part of the One House of
                                    Israel according to One Kingdom of Elohim. This process necessarily includes
                                    both Gentiles coming into the Judah Gate (<strong><em>Zechariah
                                            8:23</em></strong>) and former Israelites who have lived among the
                                    nations and are returning to their tribal inheritance, both physically and
                                    spiritually (<strong><em>Ezekiel 36:24-27</em></strong>). Finally, righteous
                                    Gentiles who have no Israelite blood whatsoever, will also be counted as priests
                                    and Levites (<strong><em>Isaiah 66</em></strong>).

                                    We believe in the literal existence of both heavenly and demonic spiritual
                                    forces, and that these same forces greatly influence good and evil effects in
                                    the physical world. Such an admission does not deny physical realities, but
                                    considers possible causes of aforesaid effects beyond bodily processes alone,
                                    for man does not live by the body and its physical needs alone
                                    (<strong><em>Deuteronomy 8:3</em></strong>), <strong><em>Y'shua</em></strong>
                                    exorcising demons from people, attempts to suggest that a metaphoric exclusivity
                                    applies to Aramaic terms such as shaida and dewa to the insane, and divorced
                                    from negative spiritual forces completely, are erroneous and fully renounced.
                                    <br><br>


                                    We further believe that the first command from <strong><em>YHWH</em></strong> to
                                    humanity includes the disciplined observation of the Earth, which is necessary
                                    to righteously "subdue" (steward) it (<strong><em>Genesis 1:28</em></strong>).
                                    Rav Shaul's command in <strong><em>1 Thessalonians 5:21-22</em></strong> to
                                    "explore everything... hold fast to the good and fly from everything evil"
                                    reflects this same method, even as we are taught in <strong><em>Psalm
                                            19:1</em></strong> that "the heavens declare the glory of Elohim; the
                                    skies proclaim the work of His hands." Therefore as the modern sciences explore
                                    <strong><em>YHWH</em></strong>'s handiwork, evidence of
                                    <strong><em>YHWH</em></strong> as the Great Designer is being progressively
                                    revealed. <br> <br>

                                    The first mention in any ancient literature of a round Earth - a sphere or khoog
                                    in the original Hebrew - is contained in <strong><em>Isaiah 40:22</em></strong>.
                                    The heavens themselves, or the face of the deep, is also described in
                                    <strong><em>Proverbs 8:27</em></strong> as having a circular character most like
                                    an orbit. It is notable that the order of Genesis of simpler life in the seas
                                    coming before land animals and culminating with man's creation is mirrored in
                                    what modern day biologists have pieced together from the fossil record. Further,
                                    in order for life to be <em>tov meod</em> (very good) it must also have within
                                    itself the ability to adapt to its environment that was also created by
                                    <strong><em>YHWH</em></strong>; or, if <strong><em>YHWH</em></strong> permits,
                                    to go extinct from the planet.

                                    annual feast celebrations. Some <strong><em>Netzari</em></strong> communities
                                    hold that "the morrow after the Sabbath" (<strong><em>Leviticus
                                            23:11</em></strong>) for putting the sickle to the grain is 16 Nisan - a
                                    premise that is also held by the Pharisees. Other
                                    <strong><em>Netzari</em></strong> hold that this
                                    <strong><em>Shabbat</em></strong> refers to the weekly
                                    <strong><em>Shabbat</em></strong> during <em>Chag haMatzah</em> (Feast of
                                    Unleavened Bread); therefore, First Fruits always falls on the first day of the
                                    week (Sunday). We follow the latter reckoning. <br> <br>

                                    We believe the Great Feasts of <strong><em>YHWH</em></strong> contain extensive
                                    spiritual and prophetic elements that can and will be accessed only by
                                    observance of these <em>Kadosh Moedim</em> (Set Apart Appointments).

                                    <strong><em>Isaiah 29:9-16</em></strong> and <strong><em>Daniel
                                            12:1-4</em></strong> demonstrate that there is a new hidden knowledge
                                    that is coming to humanity towards the End of Days. This is not, though, so much
                                    an addition to canonical texts as it is a better understanding of what has been
                                    revealed before (<strong><em>Luke 24:44</em></strong>, <strong><em>1 Corinthians
                                            13:12</em></strong>). <br> <br>
                                    Certainly, to a large degree, the "sealed book" mentioned by
                                    <strong><em>Isaiah</em></strong> can well be said to be that of the Aramaic
                                    <em>Peshitta</em>, which was in a dialect that the prophet could not read. On
                                    the other hand, the "sealed book" is also a teaching referenced partially, but
                                    not necessarily fully expounded in Set Apart Writ (<strong><em>Matthew
                                            13:11</em></strong>, <strong><em>Luke 8:10</em></strong>,
                                    <strong><em>Colossians 2:1-3</em></strong>). <br> <br>
                                    We of the <strong><em>Netzari</em></strong> faith are of one mind that the way to
                                    access the hidden knowledge is through living a moral faith-based existence
                                    coupled with serious study and reverence for the sacred texts.
                                    It is from this solid foundation that deeper insights and clarifications of the
                                    plain Word emerge, but these always enrich and never contradict that same Word. <br>
                                    <br>

                                    We of the <strong><em>Netzari</em></strong> faith remain steadfast to the decree
                                    that we are not to add or take away from the Set Apart Text, as
                                    <strong><em>YHWH</em></strong> has clearly warned us (<strong><em>Revelation
                                            22:18-19</em></strong>).

                                    <strong><em>Daniel 12:1-4</em></strong> along with a key statement by
                                        <strong><em>Y'shua</em></strong> in <strong><em>Luke 14:14</em></strong>, makes
                                        it clear that there is a separate resurrection of first the righteous and then
                                        the wicked. The plain meaning of these passages then tells us with great force
                                        that the judgment of the human <em>nefesh</em>, or soul, is not something that
                                        happens immediately after a person's death, but is deferred until the Last Day. <br> <br>
                                    
                                    Obviously if even an extremely righteous man like Samuel was not taken up to his
                                        eternal reward immediately upon his death but "slumbered" in the earth, the same
                                        must be said of the rest of us. See <strong><em>1 Samuel 28:7-15</em></strong>.
                                        More details of this principle are also provided in <strong><em>Isaiah
                                                26:12-19</em></strong>. <br> <br>
                                    Finally, as the Living <em>Miltha</em>/Word himself, <strong><em>Y'shua
                                                haMashiyach</em></strong> maintains this teaching with full force into
                                        our own day. See <strong><em>John 6:39-54</em></strong>;
                                        <strong><em>11:23-27</em></strong>; <strong><em>12:46-50</em></strong>.
